Instructions for Data Submissions to Freshwater Insects CONUS. Updated August 17, 2020. Submit data files as flat (.csv) files that are formatted according to the Data_Submission_Template. Specifically, occurrence data submissions should have column headers matching those in the Occurrence_data_template tab, and trait data submissions should have column headers matching those in the Trait_data_template tab. The description for the type of data in each column is given by the Metadata tab. This tab also describes the possible codes and abbreviations for each column, including missing value codes. Traits submitted using this template should be coded with the values in the Trait_values_definitions tab. For additional information about the types of data we are seeking, see our manuscript in review. To submit data or ask questions about the data submission process, email Dr. Phoebe Zarnetske, Michigan State University SpaCE Lab (Spatial & Community Ecology Lab) plz@msu.edu.
